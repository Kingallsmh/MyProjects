This project is a couple of months of work to try to put together a platformer type game. Inspiration was drawn from both the Mega Man and Pokemon. There was a lot of things I wanted to have as part of this project. Still a lot to come.

Goals:
-Have different characters to be played, all of which that can have different stats or moves/mechanics
-Stage that interacts with the characters with varying degrees
-Attacks that have different shapes, trajectories, damage types
-Animated backgrounds
-Switch between an overworld view and battles
-Typical RPG mechanics such as having a party of characters, stats, types that are not normally associated with platformer type games
-Items to use in or out of battle

Known issues with current issue:
-Balancing of attacks and stats (not in progress until other mechanics are finished)
-When a character has died while attacking with a melee weapon, weapon does not disappear and will continue to damage
-If a character was to a bigger character and the new characters hitbox reaches into terrain, the new character will be stuck

Future updates:
-Fix for weapon bug and stuck character
-Items for use in battle and ability to use in battle
-Dangerous terrain (Damaging spots/examples: spikes, lava pools)
-AI for the second player

Controls:
  Player 1:
  -w,a,s,d for movement
  -v,b,n,m for different attacks
  -spacebar for pause menu
  
  Player 2:
  -arrow keys for movement
  -numpad 0, 1, 2, 3 for different attacks
  -right_shift for pause menu
  
-Each character has health(the green bar segments) and energy(the blue bar segments) and each player has a timer bar(purple bar) of which restricts using the pause menu too often.
-Taking dmg reduces health, when health is 0, the character dies and the switch menu comes up.
-Using attacks uses the blue bar which will refill over time. Weapons do not use any energy.
-When the timer bar is full, that player can go into the pause menu.
-In pause menu, press down to go into party switch menu. Use the corresponding arrows to switch the current character to a new one.
First button or pause button will go exit the pause state where the second button will exit to main pause menu.
