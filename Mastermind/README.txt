School Project Mastermind
Mastermind is a game that requires two players. Someone who makes the code and the player who needs to figure it out. This game was assigned to us from Project Management. We needed to put together a project as a team using SCRUM. I was the developer for the project and so I developed the Mastermind game with Java using the LIBGDX libraries. 
Rules of the application:
-A code is generated by the program that the user has to figure out. (This code may have duplicates)
-The user can pick from the eight different coloured/numbered pegs and insert them into the empty slots in the row.
-After the user has filled out the row, the user pushes the input button to submit his guess.
-If the input has no correct pegs, the 4 indicators on the side of the row will stay empty
-If the input has correct pegs in the wrong spot, the 4 indicators will respond with the amount of those correct pegs but wrong spot with white circles.
-If the input has correct pegs and in the right spots, the 4 indicators will respond with the amount of those correct pegs with red circles.
-If the player does not figure out the code before 10 turns, the player loses
-if the play does crack the code, the player wins!

How to play:
-Click one of the pegs
-Click the spot you want to fill in the row
-When row is finished, press the input button
-After the game is finished, press “Again” to restart

Images were done by myself as well as the programming.
