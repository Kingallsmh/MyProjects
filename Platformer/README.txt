Personal Project AbsorbCore
The goal of the project was to play with simple physics components that are found in video games.  The little character can jump, fall, move left to right as per standard platformer gameplay but I wanted to have some mechanics with the character that would introduce different ways of travelling in a video game world. I added the ability to hang onto walls and ceilings as well as being able to traverse the different surfaces.
Goals for the project:
-Learn about animating sprites through programming
-Learn how to manage objects and their properties like their hitboxes
-Learn how to manipulate hitboxes and states of objects
-Learn how to dynamically have hitboxes interact with each other
-Learn how to get input from the user

Future goals for this project:
-Add a second player that interacts with previous player
-Add another movement mechanic
-add dynamic camera movement
