Critter-Haven

I have always loved the ideo of a virtual pet, like the tomagatchis or the original digimon game. 
So I made a little project that involved having a critter that you feed and pet. 
A little more time into the project and the player could play a mini-game that would involve the stats of the creature 
and some of the skill of the player. 
After the mini-game, the player would be awarded a score and some food to feed the creature.

Goals for the project:
-Learn how to save object information into a file
-Learn how to animate and use objects for animation purposes
-Learn how to use hitboxs and timers

Rules of the game:
-When you feed your creature food, you can assign it a stat and after so many stat increases, it levels up.
-You can pet your creature to increase his health points to it maximum which would be used in the mini-games.
-Pressing the save button will create a file called player.properties that has it's info.

How to play:
-Use the mouse to click the different buttons

You can play the game by downloading the .jar file.
