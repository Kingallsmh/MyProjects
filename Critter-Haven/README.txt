I have always loved the ideo of a virtual pet, like the tomagatchis or the original digimon game. So I made a little project that involved having a critter that you feed and pet. A little more time into the project and the player could play a mini-game that would involve the stats of the creature and some of the skill of the player. After the mini-game, the player would be awarded a score and some meat to feed the creature.
