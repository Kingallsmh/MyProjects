Personal Project Dodgeball

Dodgeball is a program that I put together to learn the basics of Java game making before I learned about the LIBGDX library. The idea of this project was to learn and use simple mechanics such as movement and collision detection. Along the way I learned about the idea of objects and the use of frame rates.

Goals for the project:
-Learn how to use basic movement with objects in games
-Learn how to change properties in objects as the game is running
-Learn to stay within a small scope

Rules of the game:
-You are the white square and you need dodge the red balls! Survive as long as you can as the number of red balls increases.



How to play:
-Use the keyboard directional arrows to move your square around the screen. 

You can play the game by downloading the .jar file.
